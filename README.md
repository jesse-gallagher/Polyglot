Polyglot
========

Polyglot is an experiment with making all JSR-223-compliant scripting languages present on a server available in several ways in XPages. Initially, it's via standalone scripts stored in documents in the DB that run in the context of an individual XPage, but presumably later it will also include a modified version of the generic-language bits in Ruby-in-XPages.
